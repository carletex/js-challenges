# JS Challenges

Test your JS knowledge!

## Set up

Dependencies: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/es/download/) >= 14. Our recommendation is to use a node version manager like [n](https://github.com/tj/n), so switching between versions is straight forward.

```
git clone https://github.com/carletex/js-challenges.git
cd js-challenges
```

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Usage

You can see all the challenges in the `challenges` folder.

You'll need to follow the instructions on each challenge, completing the code to make it pass the tests.

You can run all tests with `npm test` or a specific test with `npm test test/challenge1.test.js`
